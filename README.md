# Home page

## We have to implement a profile page inside the actual home page. In order to do that you have the following info:

- Action to get the user data.
- User data info inside a constant, to be returned by the /anything endpoint from httpbin.
- Httpbin docs https://httpbin.org/legacy and https://httpbin.org/anything

## To do

- [ ] Implement image layout using ionic components.
- [ ] Personal Info should display the user info.
- [ ] Teams should display the user teams array. This part is open to decide the design/layout that you prefer.
- [ ] Effects, reducers and needed selectors to implement the required layout.

## How can I send my response?

- Fork this project
- Checkout `home-page` branch
- Do your solution
- Create a merge request from your fork at home-page to this project at home-page
